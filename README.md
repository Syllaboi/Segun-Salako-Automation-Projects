## How It Works
The automation begins with a **Chatbot** node that receives user queries via a webhook. The **AI Intent Router** processes the input, determining the appropriate action based on the query. Depending on the intent, the workflow branches out to specialized tools. For instance, **CEO Leads to Customized Email** crafts personalized emails, while **CEO Scrapping** gathers web data. **Contact Agent** updates or adds contacts, and **Calendar Agent** manages calendar events. The core **Agent Smith** node orchestrates these tools, leveraging **Gemini**, **Simple Memory**, **CEO Research**, **Get Leads**, **Conversational AI**, **Content Creation Agent**, **Follow-up Email**, and **Research Workflow** to execute tasks. Responses are routed back through the **Respond to Chat** node, delivering results to the user. This seamless integration with **lovable.dev** ensures a delightful user experience, avoiding traditional bot platforms like Telegram or WhatsApp.
